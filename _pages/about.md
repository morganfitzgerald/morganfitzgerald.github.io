## About Me

I'm a PhD candidate in Computational Neuroscience at UC San Diego, where I develop data-driven methods to study how the heart and brain interact. My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, physiology, and data science — with a focus on extracting meaningful insights from complex biological signals.

I build open-source tools to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) data at scale, develop signal processing pipelines, and apply statistical modeling to characterize physiological variability across the lifespan.

I'm particularly interested in leveraging health data — from clinical datasets to wearable device signals — to improve how we measure and understand human health.

## Technical Skills
- Python (signal processing, data analysis, visualization)
- Open-source software development (PyHEARTS ECG analysis toolbox)
- Statistical modeling (SciPy, Statsmodels, bootstrapping, effect sizes)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing for large-scale physiological datasets
- Git/GitHub for version control & collaborative development
- Scientific communication & documentation

## Beyond Research
I’m passionate about using data science to make health insights more accessible — whether through open-source tooling, clean data visualization, or better signal processing pipelines.

Outside of research, I’m committed to mentorship, science communication, and advocating for inclusive and accessible health technology.

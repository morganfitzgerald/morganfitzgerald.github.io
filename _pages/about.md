I’m a PhD candidate in Computational Neuroscience at UC San Diego, developing data-driven methods to study heart-brain interactions.

My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, physiology, and data science — with a focus on extracting meaningful insights from complex biological signals to better understand human health.

## Research Overview

I build open-source tools to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, develop signal processing pipelines, and apply statistical modeling to characterize physiological variability — especially in the context of aging, cardiovascular health, and autonomic function.

I’m particularly interested in using health data — from clinical datasets to wearable devices — to improve how we measure, interpret, and monitor physiological signals in both research and clinical settings.

## Focus Areas

- ECG waveform analysis and feature extraction  
- Beat-to-beat modeling of cardiac cycles  
- Signal processing for physiological time series data  
- Statistical modeling of heart-brain interactions  
- Applications to aging, autonomic regulation, and health monitoring  

---

## Technical Skills

- Python for signal processing, data analysis, and visualization  
- Open-source software development (*PyHEARTS* ECG analysis toolbox)  
- Statistical modeling (SciPy, Statsmodels, bootstrapping, effect sizes)  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for large-scale physiological datasets  
- Git/GitHub for version control and collaborative development  
- Scientific writing, documentation, and communication

## Beyond Research

I’m passionate about using data science to make health insights more accessible — whether through open-source tooling, transparent data visualization, or better signal processing methods.

Outside of research, I’m committed to mentorship, science communication, and advocating for inclusive, accessible health technology.

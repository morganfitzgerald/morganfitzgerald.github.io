## Hello, I'm Morgan.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Dr. Bradley Voytek's](https://voyteklab.com/) lab. My interests revolve around unraveling the relationship between peripheral and cortical dynamics. Specifically, my focus lies in investigating the <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">impact of cardiac signals on scalp electroencephalography (EEG)</span>. [Read more](https://morganfitzgerald.github.io/projects) about my ongoing projects.

In addition to my research, I am deeply committed to advancing open science and diversity within the neuroscientific community. You can read more about my outreach efforts [here](https://morganfitzgerald.github.io/outreach).

## BACKGROUND

- Born in <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">Colorado</span>, raised in <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">San Diego, CA</span>.

  - My senior thesis probed the role of endogenous fluctuations in female steroid hormones on cerebellar functional dynamics, employing functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) techniques. 
    - Read the publication [here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77779-4).

- Moved back to San Diego in 2020 to join Dr. Matthew Panizzon's lab at <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">UC San Diego</span>.
  - My independent project focused on the effect of the early life hormone milieu on adult migraine risk. 
    - Read the publication [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpain.2021.766718).

- I matriuclated into the <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">Neuroscience Ph.D. program at UC San Diego</span> in September of 2022 and joined <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">Dr. Bradley Voytek's</span> lab in June of 2023.

## PERSONAL LIFE

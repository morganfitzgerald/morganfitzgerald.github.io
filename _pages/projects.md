<h1><span><strong>Beats and Brains:</strong> <em>Exploring the Heart's Role in Neural Dynamics</em></span></h1>

<h3>1. My Interest in Heart-Brain Interactions:</h3>
    I'm particularly fascinated by <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">how the heart and brain communicate with each other</span>. While a lot of the research up to now has focused on the overall patterns of heart activity, such as the rhythm of heartbeats or the variability in how quickly the heart beats, I see there's much more beneath these broad observations that we have yet to understand.

<br>
<h3>2. Are neural dynamics really neural?</h3>
    Recent work has discovered that the heart's electrical signals seem to interfere or “leak” into neural data, including data across EEG and MEG collection methods. This leakage can muddy the waters, so to speak, <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">making it hard to decipher what signals are coming from the brain and what are actually from the heart</span>. This challenges the assumption that the activities we're measuring in the brain are entirely of neural origin.
<br>
<h3>3. Developing Our Cardio-Cycle Method:</h3>
    To tackle this, <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">Eena Kosik</span> (Cognitive Science PhD student in the Voytek Lab) and I have developed an over-parameterization method that allows for a detailed analysis of the heart's signals on a <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">beat-by-beat</span> basis. This method allows us to fit a model for each cardiac cycle. Subsequently, we can reverse this model and simulate an entire electrocardiogram (ECG) record. This is incredibly powerful; in addition to capturing canonical heart metrics, it also enables us to <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">experiment with variations in the heart's electrical patterns</span>—like adjusting the height or width of a ECG peak—and examine these changes against a ground truth. Ground truth is rarely known in biology so this this gives us a level of precision, control and understanding that was previously unattainable.
<br>
<h3>4. Achieving Precision in Heart-Brain Metrics:</h3>
    This method has opened up new avenues for us, not just in simulating heart activity but also in measuring the interactions between the heart and brain with an unparalleled level of precision. This level of precision in modeling heart signals not only advances our scientific understanding but also <span style="color: #2857A7; font-weight: bold;">holds promise for revolutionizing clinical practices</span>, enabling the development of more accurate diagnostics and personalized interventions for conditions related to aging and cardiovascular diseases.

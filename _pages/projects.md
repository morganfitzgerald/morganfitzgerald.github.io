## Translating ECG Data into Insightful Health Metrics

My research bridges computational neuroscience and cardiovascular physiology. I develop open-source tools for analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals at the waveform level — enabling researchers and clinicians to extract more precise, interpretable metrics from physiological data.

Much of my work focuses on understanding heart-brain interactions — how the heart’s electrical activity both reflects and influences neural dynamics. This has applications in cognitive aging, mental health, and wearable health technology.

## Exploring the Heart's Role in Neural Dynamics

### Moving Beyond Traditional Heart Rate Metrics

While heart rate variability (HRV) has been widely studied, my work focuses on modeling ECG waveforms at the level of individual cardiac cycles. I’m particularly interested in the *shape* of heartbeats — not just their timing — and what this reveals about physiological and neural processes.

### Identifying Neural Contamination from Cardiac Signals

Emerging research shows that cardiac signals often “leak” into neural recordings like EEG and MEG. This poses challenges for interpreting brain data. Are we truly measuring neural dynamics — or partially capturing the heart?

This problem motivates much of my work in developing cleaner, more interpretable measures of heart-brain coupling.

## Developing PyHEARTS: A Beat-by-Beat ECG Analysis Toolbox

In collaboration with Eena Kosik (UCSD Cognitive Science PhD student), I’ve developed a Python-based method for over-parameterizing ECG signals — modeling each heartbeat on a beat-by-beat basis.

This approach allows us to:
- Fit Gaussian models to individual ECG waves.
- Simulate synthetic ECG data from fitted models.
- Manipulate waveform features (peak height, width, etc.) to test hypotheses.
- Establish ground truth signal properties — rare in biological data.

This toolbox provides a new level of precision for studying cardiovascular dynamics and heart-brain interaction.

## Toward Precision Biomarkers for Health & Aging

By improving the modeling of ECG waveforms, this work aims to:
- Advance our understanding of heart-brain coupling.
- Enable more accurate, interpretable physiological biomarkers.
- Inform the development of personalized health monitoring tools — especially in aging populations and cardiovascular disease contexts.

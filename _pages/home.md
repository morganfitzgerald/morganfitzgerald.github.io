# Hi, I'm Morgan.

I'm a Computational Neuroscience PhD student at UC San Diego, developing data-driven tools to understand heart-brain interactions.

My work combines signal processing, statistical modeling, and open-source development to improve how we analyze physiological data — with applications in aging, health monitoring, and wearable technology.

Outreach
========


## <strong>Background:</strong>

Since entering the scientific domain, I have been keenly aware of the underrepresentation of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in science.
I recognize the profound impact of this lack of diversity on both the research landscape and society as a whole, and the imperative need for change.

## <strong>Community Engagement at UCSB:</strong>

At UCSB, my commitment to diversity in science led me to collaborate with Girls Inc. of Santa Barbara.
I served as a mentor for over 50 female K-12 students, organizing hands-on learning experiences and lab tours.
Actively participated in UCSB's K-12 Science Outreach Committee, developing interactive science lessons for underprivileged schools.

## <strong>UCSD Involvement:</strong>

Joining Girls Inc. of San Diego and Colors of the Brain (CoB) at UCSD, I played various roles in promoting diversity.
Within CoB, I took on responsibilities as a workshop leader, mentor, and Outreach Coordinator, making a meaningful impact.
Developed and led workshops, empowering students with programming and neural signal processing skills.
Mentored a student in her research project on maternal behavior, reinforcing my commitment to supporting diverse students in science.

## <strong>Public Scientific Literacy:</strong>

As a scientist living with a disability, I am dedicated to increasing public scientific literacy.
I manage an influential outreach blog and Instagram page, reaching a community of over 20,000 individuals.
I distill complex scientific insights into accessible content on the mind-body connection, chronic pain, and disability.
Collaborate with nonprofits to advocate for meaningful legislative change in research funding and inclusion.
Advocate for prioritizing research and laboratories that champion diversity and address issues directly related to public well-being.
